# csv-to-sql

A Clojure library designed to import a CSV file into an SQL table. It can be run directly from the command line by passing a path to the CSV. Post-processing of the CSV data can be achieved with post-process methods that take in the raw data and performs a series of operations for the desired output, e.g converting a string date to a valid MySQL date.
